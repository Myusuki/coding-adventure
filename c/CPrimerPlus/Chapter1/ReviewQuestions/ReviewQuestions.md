## Question 1
- What does *portability* mean in the context of programming?
**Answer**: To be able to be used on other computers and computer architectures without much modfication.

## Question 2
- Explain the difference between a source code file, object code file, and executable file.
**Answer**: The source code file is a file that contains human readable code that the programmer wrote. The object code file is the source code file translated into machine code, however doesn't contain startup code or code needed from libraries. An executable file is an object code file with the startup code and code from libraries. 

## Question 3
- What are the seven major steps in programming?  
**Answer**: 
    - Step 1: Define the objectives of the program.
    - Step 2: Design the program.
    - Step 3: Code the program.
    - Step 4: Compile the code.
    - Step 5: Run the program.
    - Step 6: Test and Debug the program.
    - Step 7: Maintain and modify the program.

## Question 4
- What does a compiler do?
**Answer**: A compiler translates the source code file into machine code and creates respective object code files.

## Question 5
- What does a linker do?
**Answer**: It links startup code and other library functions and code to the object code file to finalize an executable file.
