- Find out what you system does with integer overflow, floating-point overflow, and floating-point underflow by using the experimental approach; that is, write programs having these problems.

- integer overflow: number loops back to the very beginning.
- floating-point overflow: no fidelity in matissa displayed and displays a 9999999 number that would've caused it to be rounded to 1.0.
- floating-point underflow: a decimal place has disappeared and has been rounded up.
