Exercise: Write a program to print the corresponding Celsius to Fahrenheit table.

Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9
9Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5 
9Celsius/5 = Fahrenheit - 32
9Celsius/5 + 32 = Fahrenheit
Fahrenheit = 9Celsius/5 + 32

Formula was a success!

Again the character width needed for the results are 5 and 18 characters respectively.
